the RAWESOME Airborne Wind Energy Simulation, Optimization and Modeling Environment

This is the top level folder. Items of interest:

rawe/ - python libraries for dynamics and optimal control
examples/ - official examples which should all work
rawekite/ - kite specific python utilities
wtfviz/ - Wind Turbine Flight Visualizer: live 3d simulation/optimization visualization using protobufs and zeromq in haskell

Items probably not of interest:

aero/ - some aerodynamic analysis stuff
studies/ - mostly deprecated examples which use rawe,
           will eventually be deleted or moved to examples/
